# View On\-Cluster Application User Interfaces<a name="on-cluster-app-UI"></a>

On\-cluster application user interfaces are hosted on the master node and require an SSH tunnel to the master node's local web server\. For more information and instructions on setting up an SSH tunnel, see [View Web Interfaces Hosted on Amazon EMR Clusters](emr-web-interfaces.md)\.

With the exception of the Spark History Server, YARN timeline server, and Hive applications, on\-cluster application history can only be viewed while the cluster is running\.

On the **Application user interfaces** tab or the cluster **Summary** page for your cluster in the Amazon EMR 6\.x console, choose the **Application user interfaces** link you want to view\.
