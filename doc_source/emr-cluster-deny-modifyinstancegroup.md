# Denying the ModifyInstanceGroup Action<a name="emr-cluster-deny-modifyinstancegroup"></a>

The [ModifyInstanceGroups](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/emr/latest/APIReference/API_ModifyInstanceGroups.html) action in Amazon EMR does not require that you provide a cluster ID with the action\. Instead, you can specify only an instance group ID\. For this reason, an apparently simple deny policy for this action based on cluster ID or a cluster tag may not have the intended effect\. Consider the following example policy\.

```
{
	"Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Action": [
                "elasticmapreduce:ModifyInstanceGroups"
            ],
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Resource": "*"
        },
        {
            "Action": [
                "elasticmapreduce:ModifyInstanceGroups"
            ],
            "Effect": "Deny",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:elasticmapreduce:us-east-1:123456789012:cluster/j-12345ABCDEFG67"
        }
    ]
    
}
```

If a user with this policy attached performs a `ModifyInstanceGroup` action and specifies only the instance group ID, the policy does not apply\. Because the action is allowed on all other resources, the action is successful\.

A solution to this issue is to attach a policy statement to the identity that uses a [NotResource](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_elements_notresource.html) element to deny any `ModifyInstanceGroup` action issued without a cluster ID\. The following example policy adds such a deny statement so that any `ModifyInstanceGroups` request fails unless a cluster ID is specified\. Because an identity must specify a cluster ID with the action, deny statements based on cluster ID are therefore effective\.

```
{
	"Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Action": [
                "elasticmapreduce:ModifyInstanceGroups"
            ],
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Resource": "*"
        },
        {
            "Action": [
                "elasticmapreduce:ModifyInstanceGroups"
            ],
            "Effect": "Deny",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:elasticmapreduce:us-east-1:123456789012:cluster/j-12345ABCDEFG67"
        },
        {
            "Action": [
                "elasticmapreduce:ModifyInstanceGroups"
            ],
            "Effect": "Deny",
            "NotResource": "arn:*:elasticmapreduce:*:*:cluster/*"
        }
    ]
    
}
```

A similar issue exists when you want to deny the `ModifyInstanceGroups` action based on the value associated with a cluster tag\. The solution is similar\. In addition to a deny statement that specifies the tag value, you can add a policy statement that denies the `ModifyInstanceGroup` action if the tag that you specify is not present, regardless of value\.

The following example demonstrates a policy that, when attached to an identity, denies the identity the `ModifyInstanceGroups` action any cluster with the tag `department` set to `dev`\. This statement is only effective because of the deny statement that uses the `StringNotLike` condition to deny the action unless the `department` tag is present\.

        {
            "Action": [

            ],
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Resource": "*"
        },
        {
            "Action": [
                "elasticmapreduce:ModifyInstanceGroups"
            ],
            "Condition": {
                "StringEquals": {
                    "aws:ResourceTag/department": "dev"
                }
            },
            "Effect": "Deny",
            "Resource": "*"
        },
        {
            "Action": [
                "elasticmapreduce:ModifyInstanceGroups"
            ],
            "Condition": {
                "StringNotLike": {
                    "aws:ResourceTag/department": "?*"
                }
            },
            "Effect": "Deny",
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ],
}
