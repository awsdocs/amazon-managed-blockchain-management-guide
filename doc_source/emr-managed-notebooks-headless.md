# Sample commands to execute EMR Notebooks programmatically<a name="emr-managed-notebooks-headless"></a>

EMR Notebook execution APIs are available to execute EMR notebooks via a script or command line\. The ability to start, stop, list, and describe EMR notebook executions without the AWS console enables you programmatically control an EMR notebook\. Using a parameterized notebook cell, you can pass different parameter values to a notebook without having to create a copy of the notebook for each new set of parameter values\. See [EMR API Actions\.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/emr/latest/APIReference/API_Operations.html)

EMR notebook execution can be scheduled or batched using AWS CloudWatch events and AWS Lambda\. See [Using AWS Lambda with Amazon CloudWatch Events](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/services-cloudwatchevents.html)

This section provides several examples of programmatic EMR notebook execution using the AWS CLI, Boto3 SDK \(Python\), and Ruby\.
