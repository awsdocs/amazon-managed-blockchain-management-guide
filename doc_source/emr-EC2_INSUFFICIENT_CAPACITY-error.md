# EC2 is Out of Capacity<a name="emr-EC2_INSUFFICIENT_CAPACITY-error"></a>

An "EC2 is out of capacity for *InstanceType*" error occurs when you attempt to create a cluster, or add instances to a cluster in a Region or Availability Zone in which the specified EC2 instance type is already at capacity\. The subnet that you select for a cluster determines the Availability Zone\.

To create a cluster, do one of the following:
+ Specify a different instance type with similar capabilities
+ Create the cluster in a different Region
+ Select a subnet in an Availability Zone where the instance type you want might be available\.

To add instances to a running cluster, do one of the following:
+ Modify instance group configurations or instance fleet configurations to add available instance types with similar capabilities\. For a list of supported instance types, see [Supported Instance Types](emr-supported-instance-types.md)\. To compare capabilities of EC2 instance types, see [Amazon EC2 Instance Types](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/)\. 
+ Terminate the cluster and recreate it in a Region and Availability Zone where the instance type is available\.
